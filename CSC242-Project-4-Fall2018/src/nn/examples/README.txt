Some examples of neural network learning:

- The ``majority'' function described in AIMA
  - generates examples on-the-fly rather than reading from a file

- A network for the iris dataset (original, non-discrete version)

- A network for the MNIST handwritten-digit classification dataset
  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/databases/mnist/
  - These files are big, so not included with this bundle. You need the following files:
    t10k-images-idx3-ubyte (7.8MB)    t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte    train-images-idx3-ubyte (47MB)    train-labels-idx1-ubyte

See class comments for some more details.
